------------
Off budget txns do not have a cat as they are not in the budget

autosuggest cat only works when first adding txn

when a txn is saved the cat is associated with the payee as cat suggest

cat
if you select income, then this txn means that the amount to budget for that month has this added to it

Another txn will automatically be created in the target acc

payee
if an account is selected in payee and this target account is in the same group as the from account ie on budget or off budget
then cat should be blank as this signifies in inter account transfer, otherwise cat should be set.

Closed accounts totals counted in overall totals

In payee
 if entry exists, eg steve's car and you type steve and hit enter then this is selected and focus goes to cat
 if you hit tab instead then steve stays in field and when you hit save, steve payee is added
