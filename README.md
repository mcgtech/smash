# Smart Cash - Smash
## Taking back control of your personal finance
Ten years ago I was trying to gain control of my finances. I had tried various apps and spread sheets, but nothing seemed to work.
Then I found YNAB - You Need A Budget, a fantastic desktop app with a simple yet powerfull approach to money management.
They subsequently moved onto a fee based web solution with a shift in approach that was not popular with reqular YNAB users.

I stuck with the desktop version until late last year when my mac stopped supporting 32 bit apps of which YNAB was one.
I decided to use my year of IT experience to build a web based version that followed the original model and to build in some of the bells and whistles that I felt were missing in the old app.

I am still in the development cycle at the moment, but once I have completed build and test I will update this documentation with installation instructions.
